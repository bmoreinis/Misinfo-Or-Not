# Instructions

You can work alone or in a team.  Each person must produce at least two posts, both as entries on the timeline / feed (index.html) AND as full post articles (post-1/index.html, etc). A team should produce at least four.  

Two of the posts must be "true" and two must be deceptive misinformation. 

The posts start on the feed page (index.html) and then the title (question) links to a post (like post-1/index.html).  On the feed page, you only have a "teaser" (a sentence or two) and one or more thumbnails (100-pixel images) but on the article page you have much more. 

For your "Information" posts, you can draw from your Misinfopedia, from the past Misinfopedia articles at https://bmoreinis.github.io/renagade/encyc, or you can make new ones. 

For your "Misinformation" posts, you can draw from the past Satire site, https://bmoreinis.github.io/renagade/satire, or you can make new ones. 

IMPORTANT: Do not ever edit backup.html - just copy and paste from there.
